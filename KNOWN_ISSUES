* Replicator

The replicator (whether invoked via _replicate or a document stored in
the _replicator database) understands two kinds of source and target;

1. A url (e.g, "https://foo:bar@foo.com/db1"), called a "remote" source/target.
2. a database name (e.g, "db1"), called a "local" source/target.

Whenever the latter type is used, this refers to a local unclustered
database, not a clustered one.

In a future release we hope to support "local" source/target to
clustered databases but for now you recommend always using the url
format for source and target.
